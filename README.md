# Flashcards
A Java application for vocabulary flashcards.

This application throws random words at the user. Cicking the word reveals the meaning. The user can add new words. (Adding words yourself might be more effective than having a readymady collectino of words).
Also allows searching and deleting words.

To set up:
    1. Extract WORDS.zip to the folder containing  the Java sources.
    2. Run VocabLearner.java. This should load all the words and display the GUI.
    3. Words can be added either through thr GUI or directly into the files (a.txt, b.txt, etc. extracted from WORDS.zip)
